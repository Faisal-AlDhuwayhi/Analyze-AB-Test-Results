# Analyze A/B Test Results
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these.

**For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.** The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

# Steps
The project is structured into main parts, which are as follows:

1. **Probability**: Which discusses the probability side in terms of the data, by applying several operations to observe different statistics and information.
2. **A/B Test**: Which the part that applies A/B testing with the usage of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.
3. **Regression**:  In this final part, you will see that the result you achieved in the A/B test in Part II above can also be achieved by performing regression.


# Requirements

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have the software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

# Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Analyze-AB-Test-Results/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Analyze_ab_test_results.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Analyze_ab_test_results.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
